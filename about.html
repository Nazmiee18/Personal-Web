          <h2>Why am I interested in Web Development</h2>
          <p>
            Why am I interested in the world of web development? Because when I went to school majoring in mechanical engineering, after studying for a year I was not at all interested in mechanical engineering, but because my brother
            graduated in informatics engineering, in the end I tried to find out about informatics engineering until finally I found something. it was called Web Development, so I studied and pursued development. Website as of now

          <h2>Why do I love game development too?</h2>
          <p>
            Because I am a person who really likes playing games, I often play games until I get bored of playing games, but again because I really like games, I thought about making my own game. When I get bored playing games, after that I
            play my own games, and after I get bored I will try to make my own games and will continue like that
